00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:27,000
and paucity of skills of the actors.

But great hearts forgive them and appreciate the effort.

[Kāñchipuram, a few years back]

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:19,050
Move … give way. Our Āchārya is coming … please give way…

11
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,050
Greetings, hope you are doing well.

12
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,009
Yes, good.

13
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:39,188
Āttigiri Aruḷāḷa … Prabhō … Vāsudēva … Namō Namaha.

14
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:40,767
Oy … who is standing in the way?

15
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,999
How would people go if you stand like this?

16
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,050
Swāmi—

17
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:48,935
He is an Āchārya. Please don’t say or do anything negative to him.

18
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,474
Mmm … He may be your Āchārya, but not mine.

19
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:57,436
I am in the exalted position of doing service to Perumāḷ.

20
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,914
Oh … This is boiling hot. Move.

21
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:02,870
Swāmi

22
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:06,300
… should the milk be so hot?

23
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:11,823
Can you not make it lukewarm before offering it to Varada?

24
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,823
Oy, you may be the Āchārya for your śiśyas. But not for me.

25
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,731
Keep your sermons for them.

26
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:24,573
My family has been serving for many generations; don’t teach me.

27
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,823
Sorry Swāmi. Please don’t say anything.

28
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,699
You are a great Āchārya, right? Why don’t you do this for Perumāḷ?

29
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:36,050
Here, take this. Go ahead.

30
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,823
Please wait. Priest, can you please bring that vessel?

31
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,998
Varada, I’m offering this milk at the right temperature for you to drink.

32
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:53,999
Please accept it.

33
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,118
Priest, please offer this to the Lord.

34
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,701
Yes, yes, offer it to the Lord.

35
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:14,999
<i>My Lord, please have this milk; it won’t burn your lips.</i>

36
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:21,116
Dear Vātsya Varada Guru, I’m overwhelmed by your love.

37
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:23,794
You gave me milk today just like my mothers,

38
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:27,032
… Kauśalya, Dēvakī and Yaṣōda.

39
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,050
In my Archai (idol) incarnation, you also become my mother.

40
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,796
O, King of all gods!

41
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:38,823
Swāmi, please forgive me.

42
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:43,092
Just like how a mother gives milk with a lot of love…

43
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:47,035
… should we also not celebrate Him in this idol form

44
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,999
with the same motherly affection?

45
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,999
After all, Varada is a God who speaks.

46
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,999
Of course, of course.

47
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,059
Since Varada has called you as His mother…

48
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,999
… we will also call you “Amma” from now on.

49
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,688
Varada…

50
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:07,999
Victory to Naḍādūr Ammāl. Victory to Naḍādūr Ammāḷ!

51
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:13,999
Welcome Rāmānuja! Welcome Vādi Hamsāmputāchārya!

52
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,935
Why address me with so much respect [when I am much smaller in stature]?

53
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,041
Why not? I am proud to call you that way.

54
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:24,531
Swans fly away on the sight of rain clouds.

55
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:28,611
Similarly, all the people who misinterpret Srī Bhaṣyakāra’s doctrines…

56
00:05:28,612 --> 00:05:32,999
… fly away in fear when you enter the hall for a debate.

57
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,200
Calling you like this gives me great happiness.

58
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:36,818
Aha!

59
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,714
That’s why I’m addressing you as Vādi Hamsāmputāchārya!

60
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:43,263
It is my privilege.

61
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,221
It is not just me, but your grace and blessings are present…

62
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:52,278
…in abundance for my brother-in-law Anantasūri and sister Tōtārambā as well.

63
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:55,100
Oh, has Anantasūri come here?

64
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:56,810
Great pleasure.

65
00:05:57,503 --> 00:05:59,142
Welcome Anantasūri.

66
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:03,456
Your father Puṇḍarīkakśa is a great Sōmayāji (one who does Vedic Sacrifices).

67
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,776
I’ve had the privilege of attending the many yajñas he has conducted.

68
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:12,911
You’ve been born in such a great lineage in Viśwāmitra clan

69
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,293
… and have married our daughter Tōtarāmbā.

70
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,919
Undoubtedly, you have the complete grace of Lord Varada.

71
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:24,862
I will pray to Him to give you a child soon.

72
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:26,876
May all good things come your way.

73
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,363
Tōtārāmbā? Tōtārāmbā.

74
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:55,999
Yes…

75
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:03,003
…I’ve been seeing you for some time now. You seem to be worried.

76
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,627
Yes Swāmi.

77
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:07,754
It’s been a while since we got married.

78
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,010
Still, we’re unable to beget a child.

79
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,999
Even Naḍādūr Ammāl blessed us the other day, right?

80
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:15,083
That’s true.

81
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,117
I have an idea.

82
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,854
I’ve been wanting to go to Tirumala for some time.

83
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,697
Shall we go on a pilgrimage to Tirumala?

84
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,458
Let us. It would be a pleasure.

85
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,050
Be careful my dear!

86
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,050
Greetings.

87
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,970
O Lord of the Holy Hills of Tivuveṅkaṭa!

88
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:35,466
We have come seeking your blessings. Please fulfil our wishes Gōvinda.

89
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:41,230
Tōtārambā, doesn’t the Lord look resplendent?

90
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,985
Yes Swāmi. My heart feels so full and happy now.

91
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,999
Srīnivāsa!

92
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,193
From where have you come, Swāmi?

93
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,474
We’re coming from Perumāḷ Kōil, Tūpul.

94
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,240
May the Lord’s blessings be with you.

95
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,025
Both of you will have a child soon.

96
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:28,999
You can stay at my humble dwelling.

97
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:30,999
That would be fine, thank you.

98
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:56,020
What is He thinking about standing all alone?

99
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:03,311
My Lord?

100
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:06,008
My Lord!

101
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,648
What’s with the deep thought?

102
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,450
Nothing, Dēvī.

103
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,412
My Lord!

104
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:16,985
Your “Nothing” has a million meanings in it.

105
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:27,545
I took many incarnations to establish Dharma (righteousness) in the world.

106
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,450
Later, I incarnated as many Āchāryas and gave the right Śāstras (doctrines) to the world.

107
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:35,684
Yes, Swāmi. What is there to think about it?

108
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:40,999
What shortcoming is there in your efforts Swāmi?

109
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,106
I understand now.

110
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:51,382
Due to Kalī’s might, adharma is prevalent everywhere.

111
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:54,629
To take people on the right path…

112
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:59,557
… there has not been a great Āchārya since Rāmānuja.

113
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:01,663
Is that not what you’re thinking?

114
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,110
Yes, Dēvī?

115
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,847
I can hear the bell in Vaikuṇṭha.

116
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,555
And I have an idea now.

117
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,224
Tell me Swāmi.

118
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:16,847
<i>Let us make our Ghaṇtāzhwār (Sacred Bell) to incarnate on earth.</i>

119
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:21,166
Earlier, a Brahmin boy called Kṛṣna did penance, remember?

120
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,504
My child, Kṛṣna!

121
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:46,558
We are happy with your penance.

122
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,223
Having got all the wealth in this birth…

123
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:55,882
<i>… you shall be born as Vēdāntāchārya in the next birth.</i>

124
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,146
You shall preach the path of complete surrender to the world…

125
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,935
…and you shall reach Us in Vaikuṇṭha.

126
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:04,393
Yes, my Lord.

127
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:12,314
You had also blessed him to be reborn as the Guru of Vēdāntic Doctrine.

128
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:13,274
Yes, he is the one.

129
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:17,171
He will reflect Me and will be an incarnation of My bell.

130
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:20,596
He will be born to Anantasūri and Tōtārāmbā.

131
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:25,497
<i>He will ensure that our sampradāya (tradition) is celebrated again.</i>

132
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:29,572
The world will know Our Grace through him.

133
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:33,262
It feels heartening to hear this Swāmi.

134
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,762
O Tirumaṅgāi of Kañchi!

135
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:38,050
He will also be the one to bring forth your greatness to the world.

136
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:43,032
Ok, come. Let’s bless Anantasūri and Tōtārāmbā.

137
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,050
Srīnivāsa … Srīnivāsa …

138
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,829
… Srīnivasa … Gōvinda!

139
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:08,085
Oh, what a beautiful dream!

140
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:16,564
What is it Tōtārambā?

141
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:20,564
Swāmi, I had a wonderful dream.

142
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:21,507
What was it?

143
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,863
I dreamt that Perumāḷ’s sacred bell was going into my stomach.

144
00:14:24,050 --> 00:12:24,999
What is it?

145
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:43,338
It is all His grace.

146
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,147
What is he looking for?

147
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:57,844
I don’t understand……

148
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:01,196
…What are you searching for?

149
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:02,383
Can’t find the bell, Swāmi…

150
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:04,494
…How come?

151
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,718
How would I know? I just got here myself.

152
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:09,050
Search inside that garland. It could be there.

153
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:12,229
What is he doing there?

154
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:13,206
What happened?

155
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:13,916
Can’t find it anywhere.

156
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,529
Did a rat take it?

157
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:17,549
Or did they distribute it too like puḷiyōtarai (tamarind rice)?

158
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:19,509
It is so strange…

159
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:22,287
…Oh! Jīya Swāmi has come. Thank God.

160
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,050
Swāmi, Perumāḷ’s bell is missing—

161
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,166
Jīya!

162
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:44,169
My bell will be born as the son of Anantasūri and Tōtārambā.

163
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:48,166
You don’t have to ring the bell for Me during the Tiruvārādhana rituals.

164
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:56,598
She had a dream last night.

165
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:58,606
In that dream, perumāḷ’s Sacred Bell …

166
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:00,401
… went into her womb.

167
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,918
Lord Vēṅkaṭēśa is going to be born as their son.

168
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:11,050
Srīnivasa … Vēṅkaṭanātha … Gōvinda … Gōvinda ……

169
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:17,689
He is the pure soul who emerged from Tūpul on the holy day Śrāvaṇam star.

170
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:23,021
He is the leader of the Holy Vēdas.

171
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:28,050
He is the pure soul who emerged from Tūpul on the holy day Śrāvaṇam star.

172
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:39,460
He is the incarnation of the divine bell of Lord of Tirumala.

173
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,050
He is the Ghaṇṭāvatāram of Srī Vēṅkaṭēśa.

174
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:54,659
He is a form of Guru Srī Rāmānuja.

175
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,001
He emerged due to the grace of Magizhmāran, the leader of Tamil Vēdas.

176
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,050
He is the pure soul who emerged from Tūpul.

177
00:17:06,347 --> 00:17:11,561
He is the light of knowledge in Kali Yuga.

178
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,050
He emerged to make the Lord of the Karigiri Hills (Lord Varada) happy.

179
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:28,191
He is the Dēsika who explained the greatness of Lord Srīranganātha’s Holy Feet.

180
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:35,050
Hail the one who conquered the fake philosophies and established Srī Rāmānuja’s Viśiṣṭhādvaita unequivocally.

181
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:40,638
Hail the one who warmed the heart of the ever-famous Srīperumbudūr-born (Rāmānujāchārya).

182
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,732
Hail the one who pleased the Lotus Dame (and received the title ‘Sarva-tantra Swatantra’)

183
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,050
Hail the one who always had in his heart the meaning of Tirumaṅgāi Āzhwār’s (six) Prabandhas…

184
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:56,424
Hail the one who clearly enunciated the rich and authentic Tamil Vēdas known as ‘Divya Prabandha’.

185
00:17:56,629 --> 00:18:02,059
Hail the one who was born as the great Bell of the Lord of the Seven Hills.

186
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:07,298
<i>Hail the one who handed us the Doctrine of Prapatti—the great means—through masterpieces like ‘Srīmad Rahasya-Traya Sāram’.</i>

187
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:12,425
Hail Vēṅkaṭanātha of Tūpul who is a Master of excellent Tamil.

188
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:18,684
Vēṅkaṭa, Tiruvēṅkaṭa!

189
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:27,228
Both of you look like a divine couple.

190
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:30,138
Today is my son’s <i>puṇyāvachanam</i> and naming ceremony.

191
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:33,912
Kindly come in and bless him.

192
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,599
He is the dear son of Anantasūri and Tōtārāmbā.

193
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,473
He has the blessings of the <i>Nithyasūrīs</i> (Eternal Souls) like Ananta and Garuḍa…

194
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:52,631
He defeated non-believers and established Tamil Vēdas.

195
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:58,050
He ensured that the sound of Praṇava echoes in every part of the world.

196
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:15,050
He is the pure soul who emerged from Tūpul on the holy day of the Śrāvaṇam star.

197
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:25,050
He is the pure soul who emerged from Tūpul on the holy day of the Śrāvaṇam star.

198
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,795
Who is it? Rāghavāchārya?

199
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:48,900
Yes.

200
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:58,519
Please come, please come Rāghavāchārya. What is the matter?

201
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:00,642
Where is little Vēṅkaṭanātha?

202
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,616
He hasn’t been coming to learn his lessons for a week now.

203
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,466
What! Hasn’t been coming for a week?

204
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:07,537
Yes. Is he in good health?

205
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:10,439
No, he is fine. Let me see.

206
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:12,119
Vēṅkaṭanātha!

207
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:14,367
Come, my child!

208
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,497
Greetings, Teacher.

209
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:16,936
Namaste!

210
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:21,050
Why have you not gone to the school for a week, my child?

211
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:26,682
Father! He is teaching me the same lessons again and again.

212
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,935
How can I complete my studies if he doesn’t teach me new lessons?

213
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:34,754
Is that so? Vēdas are <i>Śrutis</i> (those that must be heard).

214
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:37,843
They must be repeated to gain mastery.

215
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,546
I am blessed to retain your teachings when you teach just once to me.

216
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,803
How surprising! Vēṅkaṭanātha, can I test you?

217
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,999
Yes, please!

218
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,452
Tell me the first <i>Pañchati</i> in the first <i>Praśna</i> of the fourth canto?

219
00:20:54,050 --> 00:21:07,959
[Sanskṛt verse chanting]

220
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:09,743
That should do.

221
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:15,045
Anantasūri! Vēṅkaṭanātha does not need to come to <i>Santai</i> sessions any more.

222
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,050
Why?

223
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,050
I will come here to teach him.

224
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:22,050
Excellent, thank you very much.

225
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:23,017
I shall leave now.

226
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,050
Greetings.

227
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,999
Greetings.

228
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,443
I listened to this conversation.

229
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:43,649
I will teach my nephew <i>Tarka</i>, <i>Vyākaraṇa</i>, <i>Mīmāmsa</i>, <i>Kāvya</i> and <i>Nāṭaka</i>.

230
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:46,471
Tomorrow is <i>Prauṣṭhapada śravaṇa</i>.

231
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:49,837
It is the <i>Tīrthavārī</i> (Holy Immersion Festival) of our Lord Vēṅkaṭeswara.

232
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:51,307
Vijayadaśami.

233
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:54,037
Our Vēṅkaṭanātha’s birthday.

234
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:58,934
Let’s start our Śāstram lessons from tomorrow…

235
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,050
Excellent!

236
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,245
I shall take your leave.

237
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:02,713
Uncle?

238
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,541
Yes, my child?

239
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:04,715
I’ll also come along.

240
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:07,457
I am going to Naḍādūr Ammāl’s <i>Kālakśepa</i> (Traditional Learning Lessons) now.

241
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,344
It will take a long time.

242
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:12,808
Can you stay there that long?

243
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:16,506
I promise to be quiet there.

244
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:19,050
I will not disturb the Kālakśepa.

245
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:21,342
Very well. Let’s go…

246
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,121
Greetings.

247
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,963
Uncle?

248
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,410
Yes, my child.

249
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:44,050
What is the difference between Kālakśepa and <i>Upanyāsa</i> (discourse)?

250
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,137
Upanyāsas are works that help common men…

251
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:52,092
… understand epics such as the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata.

252
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,222
In Kālakśepam, āchāryas explain the texts…

253
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:58,949
… of our traditions and religious systems to their students.

254
00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:01,648
Do you see the difference now?

255
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,789
Yes, I do.

256
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,866
Uncle, I will be right back.

257
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:07,317
What happened, my child?

258
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:10,893
My <i>dhoti</i> has become dirty.

259
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:15,526
I will change and come with a <i>Daṇḍa</i> (baton) to seek the His Holiness’ blessings.

260
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:16,643
All right.

261
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:37,217
Oh, this boy looks so radiant!

262
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,341
I hope you are well.

263
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:46,382
Yes, Your Holiness.

264
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:48,946
The child looks so divine!

265
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:51,956
Isn’t he your nephew, Vēṅkaṭanātha?

266
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,839
Yes, he is!

267
00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:02,050
He looks like a re-incarnation of <i>Swāmi Rāmānuja</i>.

268
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,870
Shall we being with our Kālakśepa?

269
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:09,566
Where did we leave it before?

270
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,050
<i>Aha! The boy looks so radiant!</i>

271
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,371
This is Sudarśana Sūri.

272
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:22,149
We forgot the stopping point upon seeing the child’s radiance.

273
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:27,813
Perhaps my presence disturbed the gathering.

274
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:31,833
May I say where you stopped when I came in?

275
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:34,299
Are you sure?

276
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:36,559
Go ahead.

277
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:41,445
The first Adhikāraṇam in the first Adhyāya of <i>Srī Bhāṣyam</i>.

278
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:49,021
This is where you stopped when I came in.

279
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:53,403
Wonderful!

280
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:57,453
Vēṅkaṭanātha, come here.

281
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,499
Go, my child.

282
00:24:59,738 --> 00:25:01,050
Greetings.

283
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:30,050
[Sanskṛt verse chanting]

284
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,682
No more worries.

285
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:39,131
He shall be the protector of our Srī Bhāṣyakāra’s tradition.

286
00:25:44,638 --> 00:25:49,260
Unbelievable, Rāmānuja Swāmi!

287
00:25:49,336 --> 00:25:50,098
Yes, Your Holiness.

288
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:57,370
I’m too old to complete Kālakśepam for this young boy.

289
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,824
So, you must teach him everything.

290
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:04,727
This is also the wish of Varada.

291
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,541
So it shall be.

292
00:26:06,623 --> 00:26:07,431
Greetings.

293
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:25,326
Tirumaṅgā, can we please leave now?

294
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,448
See how beautiful Perumāḷ looks.

295
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:48,328
Wait, Mother!

296
00:28:48,592 --> 00:28:51,050
Are you coming? I’m leaving now.

297
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:55,500
Welcome, how are you?

298
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,351
Look at her.

299
00:28:57,415 --> 00:29:01,266
She is engrossed in Perumāḷ, temples, tanks and thoughts about Him all the time.

300
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:03,465
How am I to get her married?

301
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:04,955
She makes me anxious.

302
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,916
What do you think of our nephew Vēṅkaṭanātha?

303
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,192
You mean Tōtārambā’s son?

304
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:16,210
Who in entire Kāñchipuram who doesn’t know him?

305
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:20,403
He is believed that he is the incarnation of Tirumala Perumāḷ’s Holy Bell.

306
00:29:20,786 --> 00:29:24,872
Will you give your Tirumaṅgā in marriage to my nephew Vēṅkaṭanātha?

307
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:30,050
Wouldn’t that be a blessing!

308
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:31,348
Tirumaṅgā!

309
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:32,075
Yes, Mother?

310
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:34,050
Here comes his Āchārya himself.

311
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,545
What are you talking about?

312
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,823
All good things. Do you see this child?

313
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:52,050
Of course, Tirumaṅgā. I know her well. A good girl.

314
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:56,896
I was thinking if we could get her married to Vēṅkaṭanātha—

315
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:02,381
Of course, what could be better than that?

316
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,356
Varada, your wish. Good news. Let it happen.

317
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,006
Greetings.

Greetings.

Please bless Tirumaṅgā and Vēṅkaṭanātha.

320

Tirumaṅgā, I have taught Garuḍa Mantra to Vēṅkaṭanāthan.

321
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,783
He will be going to Tiruvāhīndrapuram to meditate on it.

We practice the chanting of the Garuḍa Mantra with Praṇava, the main import of all the Vēdanta.

00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:47,873
This is the mantra which has Garuḍa as its invocatory deity.

334
00:31:53,687 --> 00:32:03,204
Vynathēya. Vihākēśwara! Pakśirāja! Vēdaswarūpa. Humble greetings to you!

335
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:09,030
Vēṅkaṭanātha, being pleased with your sincere penance,

336
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:13,569
… I shall teach you the great Hayagrīva mantra.

337
00:32:14,381 --> 00:32:20,050
You will attain siddhi on performing ārādhana to this Yōga Hayagrīva idol.

338
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:46,793
<i>In His beautiful, lotus-soft four hands, Lord Hayagrīva sports the Sudarśana, Pāñchajanyam, Jnāna-Mudra and a Book.</i>

339
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,894
<i>He is seated on a freshly-blossomed White Lotus and reminds the worshippers of the whitest-white fragment of a freshly cleaved Sphaṭikam.</i>

340
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:58,288
<i>His lustre never ever fades. There is no limit to His blemish-less glories.</i>

341
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:04,354
<i>May this Lord of Vidyā shower on me His nectarine, white and cool rays! May He reside and preside over my heart in this manner!</i>
—Ślōka 32 from Hayagrīva Stotra by Swāmi Dēsika.

342
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:09,421
Hayagrīva! Gōvinda! Vāgīśa! Namō Namaha!

343
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,526
Vēṅkaṭanātha! May you drink the nectar of knowledge from me…

344
00:33:13,949 --> 00:33:16,050
… and excel in all arts.

345
00:33:16,468 --> 00:33:21,050
The Halāhala sounds in the form of neighings emanating from the divine throat of Srī Hayagrīva, the Horse-faced Lord, are the aggregate of Sāma Vēda Mantras, The word for word meanings of the Rigvēda and the abode of Yajurvēda Mantram.

346
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:26,648
These HalāHala nādhams are the destroyers of all obstacles to true Jnyanam about Chethana-Achethana-Isvara tathvams.

347
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:31,050
These Halāhala sounds are like the movement of the waves from the ocean of true knowledge (Jnānam).

348
00:33:31,522 --> 00:33:36,685
May these holy sounds chase away the inner darkness arising from the uproar of debaters whose minds are driven by their own pride, arrogance and lack of knowledge.

349
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,086
I’m worried as my father Appuḷḷār’s health is in a bad shape.

350
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,515
Please inform Veṅkanathāchārya immediately.

351
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,908
Of course, right away!

352
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:55,262
Rāmānuja … my Āchārya …

353
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,316
Uncle, I have come.

354
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,131
My child!

355
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,050
Good you came.

356
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,915
Vēṅkaṭanātha … come.

357
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:08,694
Careful, careful.

358
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,072
I lost my parents at a young age.

359
00:34:13,663 --> 00:34:20,050
You raised me as a father and mother. Now, your health—

360
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:34,050
My son, I have something to give to you. That … that … Bring that.

361
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:59,543
Rāmānuja, my Āchārya! My Rāmānuja!

362
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:10,050
These are the Holy Sandals of Swāmi Rāmānuja. This is your wealth from now on…

363
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:40,215
Swāmi! Swāmi! I have no one … no one…

364
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:55,530
<i>The size of the uñchavritti vessel is becoming bigger by the day.</i>

365
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,082
What are you saying?

366
00:35:57,707 --> 00:36:01,050
Oy, I’m not talking about you. Look there.

367
00:36:07,483 --> 00:36:12,844
What is the use of learning so much and living according to our Śāstras?

368
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:15,696
If you have to go for alms for just one bowl of rice.

369
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:16,907
Well said.

370
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,653
These scholars show off their austerity.

371
00:36:21,982 --> 00:36:24,115
They take alms in the fear that their hard-earned wealth…

372
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:28,365
…would get exhausted soon. This is Kaliyuga!

373
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:30,612
Kaliyuga.

374
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:34,852
Careful, he might curse us.

375
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:36,990
I am sure he is well-versed in matras and tantras.

376
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,681
Curse? Me?

377
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:45,335
Others may believe when he says he has the…

378
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:53,867
… grace of Garuḍa and Hayagrīva. Not me.

379
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,756
My salutations to both of you.

380
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,620
Who are you my boy?

381
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:04,658
My name is Rāmāñju. My marriage has been fixed.

382
00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:06,050
Is that so?

383
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:07,380
Yes, sir.

384
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:10,050
Excellent. Why have you come here?

385
00:37:10,799 --> 00:37:14,146
My father-in-law expects me to earn a lot of money.

386
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,678
So, I have come to earn.

387
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:18,050
A most perfect goal in life. Excellent.

388
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:25,214
Hey boy. Shall I tell you an easy way to make money?

389
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:25,912
Please tell me!

390
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,050
Do you see him there?

391
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:29,337
Yes?

392
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,430
Go to his house. He is a rich man.

393
00:37:34,623 --> 00:37:36,995
He has sacks of gold in his house.

394
00:37:37,248 --> 00:37:38,995
Really? And money?

395
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,606
Go ask him and he will give you lots of money.

396
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,325
You will find gold coins scattered on the floor of his house.

397
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,235
Will I really get lots of money if I go to his place?

398
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:46,806
Of course you will.

399
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:47,391
Will he give some to me?

400
00:37:48,357 --> 00:37:50,195
Fantastic.

401
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:52,639
You must both come for my wedding.

402
00:37:52,848 --> 00:37:55,079
Definitely. We will be there.

403
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:57,420
Now you run to his house.

404
00:38:11,347 --> 00:38:12,347
Swāmi?

405
00:38:13,945 --> 00:38:14,945
What is it, Maṅga?

406
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:20,058
I found something shiny in your uñchavritti pot today.

407
00:38:20,426 --> 00:38:22,554
Is it? Show me?

408
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,602
Oh! I refused the money that Taṇika Mādhavāchārya gave.

409
00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:38,050
That is probably why he put these gold coins in the pot today without my knowing.

410
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:39,134
All right.

411
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:43,062
Maṅga, these are poisonous germs.

412
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:47,847
They are unfit to be offered as part of Ārādhana.

413
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:06,573
Here you go, it is clean.

414
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:09,833
Go and prepare food for offering to God.

415
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:10,884
All right, Swāmi.

416
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:22,050
<i>Ah, just like the men said, there are coins lying around!</i>

417
00:39:22,635 --> 00:39:23,635
Greetings!

418
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:27,015
Who are you, child?

419
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,920
Sir, my marriage has been fixed.

420
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,762
I came here because people said I will get a lot of money if I came to you.

421
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:36,656
That aside, did you eat?

422
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:38,987
<i>I drank a lot of water from the Anantasaras Puṣkariṇī.
(The tank of Varada’s temple.)</i>

423
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:40,332
What?!

424
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:48,000
Maṅga? A boy has come. Could you serve him some food?

425
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,314
Yes, Swāmi.

426
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:51,836
Sir, what about money?

427
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,154
Eat first.

428
00:39:56,692 --> 00:40:03,161
Those in this world who wish to start yogic activities…

429
00:40:03,162 --> 00:40:09,585
… with an eager mind approach you to seek wealth…

430
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:15,365
… for dharmic activities. Give them their desire of…

431
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:21,889
… wealth and allow it to grow.
—Verse 16, Srī Stuti by Vēdānta Dēsika.

432
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:26,979
O Mother! Mahālakśmi! Perundēvī! Jagadjananī! Please bless this child.

433
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:28,936
Shower of gold coins! What a wonder!

434
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,909
Swāmi, there is no match for your greatness.

435
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,890
This is all for you. Take them, child.

436
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:39,095
Peraruḷāḷa permanently resides in the hills of Hastigiri.

437
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:44,001
He emerged from the Aśwamēdha Yajna of Brahma and looked like a fire with a bluish hue.

438
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:48,526
His beauty is further accentuated by the presence of His consort who appears like…

439
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:53,050
… a golden creeper embracing the Karpaga tree.
—Verse 1, Srī Varadarāja Pañchaśat.

440
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,503
Thus, Brahma carried out the Aśwamēdha Yajna for destruction of his…

441
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:57,070
… karmas that led him earlier to think that insignificant worldly pleasures…

442
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:58,615
… are great and lasting. At the conclusion of the Aśwamēdha with…

443
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,799
… great bhakti for the Lord, Brahma Dēva performed the Vapā hōma.

444
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,051
Immediately thereafter, the supreme radiance of the Lord arose from the middle…

445
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:09,031
… of the Yajna Kuṇḍa shining like thousands of suns. It was like the rise of…

446
00:41:09,032 --> 00:41:13,070
… a golden mountain surrounded by Puṇya Kōṭi Vimāna, which made the regular sun…

447
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,825
… look like the lamp lit on a bright day.
—Verse 15 from Atithigiri Mahātmyam by Swāmi Dēsika.

448
00:41:18,217 --> 00:41:46,237
[Verse 3 from Āṇḍāḷ’s Tiruppāvai Pāsuram]

449
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,903
Stop it! Stop it!

450
00:41:48,902 --> 00:41:50,464
Why should we stop?

451
00:41:50,704 --> 00:41:53,210
In place of the Vēdas that have no beginning or end…

452
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:59,109
…we will never accept singing songs in the baseless Tamil!

453
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:02,868
This Adhyāyana Utsava has been happening since the times of Kaliya.

454
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,202
Nothing doing!

455
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:09,225
Other than Sanskṛt, the commoner’s languages such as Tamil…

456
00:42:09,372 --> 00:42:11,922
…should not be heard inside the temple premises.

457
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:18,046
The low-caste-born Āzhwārs should not worshipped inside the temple.

458
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,268
Why should we stop? We will go ahead with the Adhyāyana Utsava.

459
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:26,726
In that case, win a debate on this topic with us and continue your Utsava.

460
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:33,285
Otherwise, we’ll never allow singing of Tamil songs in any temple.

461
00:42:33,314 --> 00:42:37,596
Oh, all right. Let us debate.

462
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Yes, let’s see.

463
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:47,707
We must immediately inform Sudharśana Sūrī of Srīraṅgam…

464
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,932
… that the Adhyāyana Utsava has been stopped.

465
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,359
Come, let us go.

466
00:42:58,814 --> 00:43:00,095
Hey, Raṅganātha!

467
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,645
What kind of a test is this?

468
00:43:03,823 --> 00:43:06,702
Adhyāyana Utsava has been stopped!

469
00:43:07,904 --> 00:43:10,119
I have grown old now.

470
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:14,323
I do not have the energy for a debate any more.

471
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:17,717
What is it that you are doing?

472
00:43:18,747 --> 00:43:22,529
Who else do I have other than you, Raṅga?

473
00:43:22,827 --> 00:43:28,050
Tell me what is in your mind, Raṅganātha!

474
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:44,327
What a wonder! The flowers from His chest have fallen on the bell.

475
00:43:44,696 --> 00:43:49,618
This is His order. He has chosen Vēṅkaṭanātha for this debate.

476
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,321
Srīnivasa! Go to Kāñchipuram, inform Vēṅkaṭanātha about this…

477
00:43:54,337 --> 00:44:01,050
… and bring him with you. Quick. Go on.

478
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,050
As you wish, Swāmi.

479
00:44:22,482 --> 00:44:27,730
This temple is the home of the sweetest nectar.

480
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:33,393
This was the gift given by Brahma to the king of Ayōdhyā.

481
00:44:33,527 --> 00:44:39,452
This was the temple prayed to by the invincible Rāma.

482
00:44:39,453 --> 00:44:45,922
This temple was given by Rāma to Vibhīṣaṇa.

483
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:51,670
This temple gives all the combined benefits.

484
00:44:51,671 --> 00:44:57,982
This is the temple with its Vimāna shaped as the Praṇava.

485
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:04,784
This is the temple that resolves all problems.

486
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:10,050
This is the temple of Srīraṅgam.

487
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,611
Raṅga, why is he not here yet?

488
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,797
This delay—

489
00:45:26,293 --> 00:45:30,657
Welcome, welcome. I was waiting for you.

490
00:45:30,883 --> 00:45:31,883
What would you like me to do?

491
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:36,092
They are stopping Perumāḷ’s Adhyāyana Utsava.

492
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:38,910
You’re an incarnation of Rāmānuja.

493
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:45,106
My āchārya Nadādūr Ammāḷ’s blessings are with you.

494
00:45:45,344 --> 00:45:49,909
You must defeat them in the debate.

495
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,070
Salutations.

496
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,050
Here comes Tūpul Vēṅkaṭanāthāchārya.

497
00:45:55,225 --> 00:45:58,160
My salutations to all of you.

498
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,684
May victory be yours!

499
00:46:00,074 --> 00:46:01,050
<i>What radiance!</i>

500
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,347
<i>So, are you the Vēṅkaṭanātha?</i>

501
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,656
<i>Isn’t the ākāram a little too shrunken? [Pun on appearance]</i>

502
00:46:20,005 --> 00:46:27,400
<i>Paṇḍitji, can ākāram shrink? [Pun, again.]</i>

503
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:32,654
It is surprising to see that you don’t have this basic literary knowledge!

504
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:40,232
That apart, why did you try to stop the Adhyāyana Utsava…

505
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:44,001
… that has been happening since ancient times?

506
00:46:44,108 --> 00:46:47,307
At home, you can talk in whatever language you want.

507
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:51,729
But a temple is a divine place, where lowly languages are not allowed.

508
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,217
What is low? Ṛśis like Agastya have developed this language.

509
00:46:56,218 --> 00:47:01,056
These sacred Tamil Hymns are ancient and have no equivalent to them.

510
00:47:02,174 --> 00:47:06,080
Do you know how foolish it is to call this a lowly language?

511
00:47:06,922 --> 00:47:13,241
The Perumāḷ and Āzhwārs love it when we sing in our mother tongue.

512
00:47:13,717 --> 00:47:16,021
Can we call this a lowly language?

513
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:20,292
<i>We are Vaidikas; those who follow the vedic Śastras.</i>

514
00:47:20,598 --> 00:47:27,800
So, we will never accept any language other than Sanskṛt.

515
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,166
O scholars! Sanskṛt is indeed a great language.

516
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:37,217
But why don’t you try to experience the bliss that comes with listening to our Āzhwār’s songs?

517
00:47:37,409 --> 00:47:43,784
Doesn’t the Sanskṛt Vēda recitation group follows the Perumāḷ during utsavas?

518
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:51,611
<i>True. But doesn’t also the Perumāḷ follow the Divya Prabandha
recitation group during the same utsavas?</i>

519
00:47:51,727 --> 00:47:57,663
Doesn’t this show the greatness of Tamil as well? Think about it.

520
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:01,919
Paṇḍits, we are those who have mastered the Vēdas in both Tamil and Sanskṛt.

521
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:06,232
Tamil and Sanskṛt are equally important to us.

522
00:48:07,106 --> 00:48:12,471
How can you choose between the two of your eyes?

523
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:17,371
Kaliya started this utsava and Nāthamuni continued…

524
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:19,279
… it with fervour. It was firmly established by…

525
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:22,322
…Swāmi Rāmānuja. Since this has been happening for…

526
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:26,223
… such a long time, it is foolishness to stop it now.

527
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:34,103
Even if we agree, not all Āzhwārs (Tamil saints) are brahmins!

528
00:48:34,461 --> 00:48:40,379
Is it not a sin to worship their idols inside the temple?

529
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:45,463
What is sin? Our Perumāḷ has accepted them with love.

530
00:48:46,317 --> 00:48:49,867
Don’t you know the story of Thiruppān Āzhwār who…

531
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:53,673
… was carried by sage Lōka Sāraṅga on his shoulders?

532
00:48:54,158 --> 00:49:01,221
Raṅganātha is waiting to listen to Āzhwār’s pasurams. Don’t stop it.

533
00:49:01,129 --> 00:49:01,873
But—

534
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:06,842
But, what? This is also the Vedic path.

535
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:12,050
It is our pride to chant Prabandhas (Tamil Hymns) in temples!

536
00:49:12,456 --> 00:49:13,009
Why limit it to here?

537
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:22,443
<i>We will sing our Āzhwār’s Pallāndu pallāndu even in Vaikuṇṭha!</i>

538
00:49:22,806 --> 00:49:26,774
From now on, there should be no hindrance to Raṅganātha’s utsava!

539
00:49:27,055 --> 00:49:30,972
<i>Open the Paramapadam Gate. Let Raṅganātha’s procession begin!</i>

540
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,507
Since you won the debate today, you will henceforth…

541
00:50:09,522 --> 00:50:13,744
… be called Vēdantāchārya. This is Raṅganātha’s order.

542
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,557
My privilege!

543
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:27,285
Victory be to Swāmi Vedāntāchārya!

[Periyāzhwār Tirumozhi, Pāsuram 1-2-1]

545
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:21,946
Hey Maṅgaḷam? Why are you awfully quiet?

546
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,835
Watch your step!

547
00:51:25,468 --> 00:51:28,063
I’m seeing everything. Tell me.

548
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,716
What is there to say?

549
00:51:30,814 --> 00:51:33,783
Even Maṅga doesn’t say anything.

550
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:37,175
Oh yes, she doesn’t express anything.

551
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:38,412
That’s why she doesn’t talk.

552
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:40,315
That is right.

553
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,799
Doesn’t wear any jewellery…

554
00:51:43,002 --> 00:51:45,578
… hides all of it, and…

555
00:51:45,576 --> 00:51:47,963
… walks around as though she has nothing…

556
00:51:48,453 --> 00:51:50,314
… They say, her husband is a great scholar.

557
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:52,133
He must have many students.

558
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:53,797
Would there be dearth of money?

559
00:51:54,593 --> 00:51:55,874
She must be saving a lot of money.

560
00:51:56,312 --> 00:51:57,781
She should have garlands of pearls…

561
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,573
… rubies and other precious stones.

562
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:01,136
Maybe she doesn’t wear them because…

563
00:52:01,137 --> 00:52:03,328
… we’ll be jealous of it all.

564
00:52:03,447 --> 00:52:05,737
You are right.

565
00:52:06,341 --> 00:52:08,830
Maṅga, these people are talking ill of you.

566
00:52:08,823 --> 00:52:10,441
Why aren’t you saying anything?

567
00:52:10,488 --> 00:52:11,336
Leave them. Let them talk.

568
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:13,779
Kamalā, do you know something?

569
00:52:13,782 --> 00:52:14,898
No, what is it?

570

<i>When her husband recites the Mahālakśmi stōtra,</i>

571
00:52:17,772 --> 00:52:19,398
… apparently, gold coins pour down.

572
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,111
Everyone around gets them; takes them home.

573
00:52:22,254 --> 00:52:24,429

574
00:52:24,572 --> 00:52:26,876
I don’t wish for any other wealth.

575
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:29,811
I haven’t desired anything either.

576
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,521
Did her husband really give all that money to that boy?

577
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,148
What do you say of that?

578
00:52:34,347 --> 00:52:35,968
Dispassion.

579
00:52:36,922 --> 00:52:37,622
Did you know?

580
00:52:37,964 --> 00:52:40,129
Apparently, many kings met with him.

581
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:42,823
And this man never bothered about all that!

582
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:45,567
Apparently, he threw away all the gold coins…

583
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:47,662
… that he had gleaned.

584
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:49,825
(Mockingly) Some life he lives!

585
00:52:50,196 --> 00:52:50,896
Maṅga…

586
00:52:51,365 --> 00:52:54,297
… Your married life is a disaster.

587
00:52:54,736 --> 00:52:56,843
Stop hurting her feelings.

588
00:52:57,514 --> 00:52:59,919
Her life is much better than all ours.

Very bad of you all.

592

Whatever, Kamalā.

593
00:53:09,303 --> 00:53:11,873
They will never be as smart as you.

594
00:53:12,013 --> 00:53:14,939
Isn’t it the wife’s responsibility to advise her husband?

595
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,072
If not for themselves,

596
00:53:17,121 --> 00:53:19,612
… mustn’t they save for their children?

597
00:53:19,637 --> 00:53:21,407
What children?

598
00:53:21,705 --> 00:53:23,663
She seems barren.

599
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:27,886
That’s enough!

600
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,367
Watch your words.

601
00:53:32,156 --> 00:53:34,865
Paṅkajam, what they’re saying is right.

602
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:38,623
But there are things beyond the reach of their minds.

603
00:53:38,624 --> 00:53:42,734
Those that live in the vanity of material wealth and those

604
00:53:42,735 --> 00:53:47,086
that discard material and hold in their heart the only dweller

01:16:40,584 --> 01:16:43,142
But isn’t Vidyāraṇya your childhood friend?

842
01:16:45,071 --> 01:16:45,771
Yes, he is.

843
01:16:46,321 --> 01:16:54,228
But here, facts presented in the argument matter; one must be objective.

844
01:16:54,991 --> 01:17:03,150
Kumāravarada, you were born to me after years of childlessness.

845

<i>That is my privilege.</i>

846
01:17:04,932 --> 01:17:08,745
Our ancestors have always walked the path of dispassion.

847
01:17:09,787 --> 01:17:11,212
Dispassion, determination and walking on the…

848
01:17:11,213 --> 01:17:12,738
… path shown by our scriptures go hand in hand.

849
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:22,405
I wear these studs because of their austere penance.

850
01:17:22,622 --> 01:17:27,955
Even your mother wears only those ornaments…

851
01:17:27,956 --> 01:17:32,126
… that she wore during our wedding.

852
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:37,907
To us, dispassion and following the divine path are important.

853
01:17:38,264 --> 01:17:39,274
Do you understand?

854
01:17:39,328 --> 01:17:39,859
I do.

855
01:17:49,626 --> 01:17:52,889
Oy, Vaiṣṇava!

856
01:17:53,138 --> 01:17:53,838
Stop.

857
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:56,807
How come you are trying to ignore me?

858
01:17:57,969 --> 01:17:58,669
Who are you?

859
01:17:59,073 --> 01:18:00,916
Why should I particularly notice you?

860
01:18:00,928 --> 01:18:01,971
Don’t you know who I am?

861
01:18:02,097 --> 01:18:05,037
I am an expert in black magic.

862
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:09,039
I control all the demons.

863
01:18:09,907 --> 01:18:13,177
Everyone in this village should obey me going forward.

864
01:18:13,482 --> 01:18:14,565
Otherwise……

865
01:18:14,744 --> 01:18:17,994
…Do you see our Āchārya there?

866
01:18:18,301 --> 01:18:19,519
Vēdānta Dēsika.

867
01:18:20,207 --> 01:18:22,130
His grace rules this land.

868
01:18:22,173 --> 01:18:24,380
Your tantras won’t work here.

869
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:27,126
Go show your tricks elsewhere.

870
01:18:31,326 --> 01:18:33,308
Such disdain!

871
01:18:33,979 --> 01:18:35,750
Let me see who it is.

872
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,779
Let me see.

873
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:48,860
Swāmi.

874
01:18:50,563 --> 01:18:51,719
Yes, Hastēśa?

875
01:18:52,797 --> 01:18:54,627
I have a request.

876
01:18:55,312 --> 01:19:00,141
Hastēśa, you are my favourite disciple.

877
01:19:00,824 --> 01:19:04,247
So far, you have not asked anything of me.

878
01:19:04,809 --> 01:19:07,450
Do not hesitate to ask; what do you wish?

879
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:13,305
This materialistic life does not interest me.

880
01:19:15,444 --> 01:19:20,642
I want renunciation, and I need your blessings for it.

881
01:19:22,651 --> 01:19:27,386
Your determination is exemplary.

882
01:19:28,693 --> 01:19:34,010
You have the blessings of the Almighty and Rāmānuja.

883
01:19:34,848 --> 01:19:37,735
May your wish be fulfilled.

884
01:19:38,435 --> 01:19:39,379
Come, let us go.

885
01:19:44,352 --> 01:19:48,123
What radiance! Let me go closer.

886
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:56,048
Hmm, something seems to stop me.

887
01:19:56,710 --> 01:20:03,170
I must do more penance to be able to act against him.

888
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:13,640
Swāmi, what happened?

889
01:20:18,741 --> 01:20:22,928
Something is not right.

890
01:20:23,751 --> 01:20:24,648
What?!

891
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,194
Nṛsimha!

892
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:38,006
With the fierce rituals I plan to perform today…

893
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:43,353
… the Vaiṣṇava shall die of a bloated stomach.

894
01:20:56,747 --> 01:21:00,322
Let me preserve some of the soil from his footsteps.

895
01:21:03,045 --> 01:21:06,806

[Dark chants]

897
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:06,414
Today, Hastīśa expressed his desire to renounce…

898
01:22:06,415 --> 01:22:11,179
<i>… worldly pleasures and become a sanyāsī.</i>

899
01:22:13,824 --> 01:22:16,913
And I consented.

900
01:22:18,956 --> 01:22:22,091
Here, I fill his stomach with this water.

901
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:30,732
This is the end of Vēṅkaṭanātha!

902
01:22:31,788 --> 01:22:34,986
Swāmi, what happened?!

903
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,093
Why is he in pain?

904
01:22:47,986 --> 01:22:50,915
It is all due to the tantras.

905
01:22:52,065 --> 01:22:57,663
Some black magician has sinned against me.

906
01:22:58,251 --> 01:23:00,256
Black magician? Who?

907
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:07,522
Ah, my stomach is bloating. Nṛsimha!

908

I am asking you to tie your horse and…

1024
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:25,864
… you are asking for milk in the midnight?

1025
01:38:26,819 --> 01:38:29,662
Already the harvest hasn’t been good for years.

1026
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:31,271
There’s been drought.

1027
01:38:31,695 --> 01:38:33,188
Now this?

1028
01:38:33,444 --> 01:38:34,580
Please don’t be angry.

1029
01:38:34,489 --> 01:38:35,511
All right, give me a moment.

1030
01:38:37,521 --> 01:38:39,351

Here, drink this milk.

1037

And bless this farmer.

Maṅga, let’s go.

1039
01:39:19,117 --> 01:39:20,967
Sir, thank you.

1040
01:39:25,193 --> 01:39:26,732
Ah, what in the world is this?!

1041
01:39:27,319 --> 01:39:31,361
There is gold along the horse’s path!

1042
01:39:32,268 --> 01:39:33,629
What wonder is this?

1043
01:39:34,809 --> 01:39:36,097
O, great man!

Please make way for Kavitārkika Simha.

1055
01:40:30,503 --> 01:40:32,710
So he is the Kavitārkika Simha?

1056
01:40:32,757 --> 01:40:34,799
Yes, he is.

1057
01:40:34,923 --> 01:40:38,489
The lion (king) among poets is the Kavitārkika Simha.

1058
01:40:40,708 --> 01:40:45,719
Don’t you know about his Sanskṛt and Tamil hymns?

1059
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:49,830
He has written so many Stōtras in Sanskṛt…

1060
01:40:49,831 --> 01:40:53,455
…and Prabandhas in Tamil.

1061

Our elders have said this, haven’t you heard?

1064
01:41:13,335 --> 01:41:15,407
I haven’t come to argue with you.

1065
01:41:15,688 --> 01:41:17,793
If he is a great poet…

1066
01:41:18,022 --> 01:41:20,110
… and has won many awards…

1067
01:41:20,753 --> 01:41:22,567
… will he be able to compete with me?

1068
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,959
What an absurd question!

1069
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:27,529
Vāsudēva, that is enough.

1070
01:41:28,413 --> 01:41:32,113
Control yourself. Never condescend a devotee.

1071
01:41:34,379 --> 01:41:35,191
Why the silence?

1072
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:39,635
Worried that your (lack of) skills will be revealed?

1073

O, scholar…

… I don’t support conflict among Vaiṣṇavas.

1078

I have no qualms in accepting…

1079
01:42:01,654 --> 01:42:05,679
… that you are a poet par excellence.

1080
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:10,601

I can write a thousand verses about the Lord’s holy feet.

1085
01:42:29,177 --> 01:42:32,386
Likewise, you must also write.

Let the Vaiṣṇavas decide next morning…

What is my dear friend Pāduka Dēvī thinking about?

Let me see what it is.

1092
01:43:41,479 --> 01:43:43,803
What is with the deep thought?

1093
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:45,764
Oh, nothing at all.

1094
01:43:46,423 --> 01:43:51,786
Right, your nothing does not mean a million things.

1095
01:43:52,288 --> 01:43:55,036
Do you know our Vēṅkaṭanātha?

1096
01:43:55,099 --> 01:43:56,863
Yes, what about him?

1097
01:43:56,890 --> 01:44:03,422
Well, you know he has sung songs about the many consorts of the Lord.

1098
01:44:03,558 --> 01:44:04,258
Right.

1099
01:44:04,546 --> 01:44:07,833
Of all the consorts he has sung about, he has never…

1100
01:44:07,834 --> 01:44:10,788
… even sung once about me, the Pādukādēvī.

1101
01:44:12,189 --> 01:44:14,581
One needs to be fortunate, perhaps.

<i>That is what you are thinking about?</i>

1103
01:44:16,676 --> 01:44:23,344
Perhaps Vēṅkaṭanātha is waiting for the right opportunity.

1104
01:44:24,188 --> 01:44:29,074
What opportunity? He just lost a golden one.

1105
01:44:29,164 --> 01:44:31,663
Did you not see it yourself, Dayādēvī?

1106
01:44:31,701 --> 01:44:34,713
He did not take that poet’s challenge to write a…

1107
01:44:34,714 --> 01:44:37,682
… thousand verses about the holy feet of the Lord.

1108

You have a point.

Instruct him to write a thousand verses on Pādukā Dēvī tonight.

1112
01:45:05,763 --> 01:45:09,798

… to be liberated from this world.

1189
01:52:47,115 --> 01:52:53,216
How true is all that our elders told us!

1190
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:29,749
By order! By order! Swāmi Dēsika is arriving.

1191
01:53:34,756 --> 01:53:44,049
[Recitation of Verse 1008 from the Pādukā Sahasram by Swāmi Dēsika]

1192
01:54:07,116 --> 01:54:07,816
Swāmi?

1193
01:54:08,803 --> 01:54:09,902
Yes, Maṅga?

1194
01:54:11,106 --> 01:54:14,210
It is going to be the twelfth in a couple of days—

1195
01:54:15,948 --> 01:54:17,307
Okay, so?

1196
01:54:17,862 --> 01:54:20,620
No, typically, after bath I recite…

1197
01:54:20,621 --> 01:54:23,992
… all the four thousand hymns while cooking…

1198
01:54:23,993 --> 01:54:25,331
… before you come.

1199
01:54:25,376 --> 01:54:26,725
But it won’t be possible when…

1200
01:54:26,726 --> 01:54:28,159
… the twelfth finishes before dawn.

1201
01:54:28,289 --> 01:54:29,161
What do I do?

1202
01:54:30,691 --> 01:54:31,801
Good question.

1203
01:54:32,415 --> 01:54:34,787
Swāmi, I have a request as well.

1204
01:54:35,012 --> 01:54:37,383
You too? What is it, Rājagōpāla?

1205
01:54:37,651 --> 01:54:41,574
Please explain to us the essence of the Divya Prabandhas.

1206
01:54:41,769 --> 01:54:48,164
All right. I will mention the Āzhwārs’ days of birth…

1207
01:54:48,165 --> 01:54:54,166
… the stars, places and the count of the Prabandhas…

1208
01:54:54,167 --> 01:54:58,265
… in a work called Prabandha Sāram.

1209
01:54:58,691 --> 01:55:02,160
So that those who recite the essence get the…

1210
01:55:02,161 --> 01:55:05,586
… same benefits as reciting all the Prabandhas.

1211
01:55:05,735 --> 01:55:09,420
Maṅga, go and start your work.

1212
01:55:12,170 --> 01:55:18,404
Swamy Dēsikan records precisely for posterity…

1213
01:55:18,405 --> 01:55:25,321
… the authentic division of the 4000 sacred collect:

1214
01:55:25,322 --> 01:55:33,460
Toṇḍaraḍippoḍi (55 Pāsurams); Pāṇar (10); Tirumaṅgāi (1253)…

1215
01:55:33,461 --> 01:55:41,941
… the salvation-granting pāsurams of Amudanār on Srī Bhāṣyakāra’s…

1216
01:55:41,942 --> 01:55:49,539
… sacred feet (108); Mudal Āzhwār (300 in total with 100…

1217
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:58,581
… each for Poigai, Bhūtam and Pēy); the luminous Tirumazhisai (216)…

1218
01:55:58,582 --> 01:56:03,152
… The Pāsurams of Swāmy Nammāzhwār…

1219
01:56:03,153 --> 01:56:12,996
… which are the essence of Vēdam (1296 housed in his four Prabhandhams)…

1220
01:56:12,997 --> 01:56:21,316
… the generous Madhura Kavi known for his Āchārya Bhakti (10)…

1221
01:56:21,317 --> 01:56:28,373
… King Kulaśēkhara (105); Periyāzhwār (473) and Āndāl…

1222
01:56:28,374 --> 01:56:34,909
… who is an incarnation of the Bhūmi Dēvī (173).

1223
01:56:34,910 --> 01:56:40,141
All of these add up to 4000 Pāsurams…

1224
01:56:40,142 --> 01:56:45,875
… that are the means to our upliftment.

1225
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:56,294
Watch your step. Careful.

1226
01:56:56,852 --> 01:57:00,628
Swāmi Desika is here.

1227
01:57:01,231 --> 01:57:02,255
O great man!

1228
01:57:02,968 --> 01:57:05,221
Please forgive me.

1229
01:57:05,425 --> 01:57:07,176
Who … who are you?

1230
01:57:09,372 --> 01:57:10,271
Who are you?

1231
01:57:11,683 --> 01:57:16,357
Ah, aren’t you Kandāḍai Lakśmaṇāchārya?

1232
01:57:18,008 --> 01:57:24,613
Why has your health deteriorated so much?

1233
01:57:25,722 --> 01:57:30,121
All because of a sin I committed against you unknowingly.

1234
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:38,613
When you were in Srīraṅgam, I came your way.

1235
01:57:39,395 --> 01:57:44,789
Engrossed in holy scriptures, you did not notice me.

1236
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:49,051
My disciple forcefully brought you to me.

1237
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:54,432
I didn’t know about this at the time.

1238
01:57:54,433 --> 01:57:59,244
Upset by the incident, you left Srīraṅgam…

1239
01:57:59,245 --> 01:58:02,290
… and came to Satyamangalam.

1240
01:58:02,797 --> 01:58:09,204
But a student’s actions affect the guru, and here I am in this state.

1241
01:58:09,667 --> 01:58:10,605
What is this?!

1242
01:58:12,392 --> 01:58:13,390
Please get up.

1243
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:18,828
Swāmi, the water from your feet is the cure for my illness.

1244
01:58:22,166 --> 01:58:23,620
Srīman Nārāyaṇa!

1245
01:58:30,688 --> 01:58:41,116
[Recitation single-verse praise for Swāmi Desika]

1246
01:58:44,798 --> 01:58:49,261
Swāmi, please also grant us a boon to beget a child.

1247
01:59:00,330 --> 01:59:04,100
Swāmi, Swāmi! A great calamity has befallen us!

1248
01:59:04,983 --> 01:59:09,245
Dēvarāja, why are you in panic?

1249
01:59:10,037 --> 01:59:11,167
Calm down.

1250
01:59:11,804 --> 01:59:14,652
How do I even begin, Swāmi?

1251
01:59:15,056 --> 01:59:16,840
What happened?

1252
01:59:17,796 --> 01:59:19,428
I don’t understand anything, Dēvarāja.

1253
01:59:19,728 --> 01:59:23,396
The Turkish invaders are destroying Srīraṅgam, Swāmi!

1254
01:59:23,425 --> 01:59:25,122
Ah, it is indeed horrible!

1255
01:59:27,758 --> 01:59:30,859
They are destroying everything they see.

1256
01:59:31,813 --> 01:59:35,397
The Turkish army has come until Kaṇṇūr!

1257
01:59:35,556 --> 01:59:37,832
Raṅga! Raṅga!

1258
01:59:39,984 --> 01:59:43,801
Ambarīśa, did you hear what Dēvarāja said?

1259
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:46,738
I’m unable to decide what to do!

1260
01:59:46,923 --> 01:59:49,460
Their main aim is to destroy Raṅganātha’s temple!

1261
01:59:57,233 --> 01:59:59,623
What dangerous game is this?

1262
01:59:59,636 --> 02:00:01,743
Srīraṅgam is in danger!

1263
02:00:01,756 --> 02:00:05,119
Raṅga, should you test us like this?

1264
02:00:06,994 --> 02:00:07,866
Ambarīśa!

1265
02:00:08,273 --> 02:00:10,163
First of all, ring the big bell and announce the situation.

1266
02:00:10,273 --> 02:00:15,784
Ask all our people to remain alert and careful.

1267
02:00:15,787 --> 02:00:19,487
Call all our palanquin bearers.

1268
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:22,959
Ring the bell and announce the impending danger.

1269
02:00:22,947 --> 02:00:23,998
Dēvarāja.

1270
02:00:24,686 --> 02:00:27,108
It’s time to act swiftly.

1271
02:00:27,436 --> 02:00:29,147
We mustn’t waste time.

1272
02:00:29,162 --> 02:00:32,193
Guard the main deity and the idol we use for procession.

1273
02:00:32,484 --> 02:00:37,398
We must guard all of Raṅga’s jewels and vessels.

1274
02:00:37,456 --> 02:00:38,511
Yes, yes.

1275
02:00:38,623 --> 02:00:41,210
Priest, please get started.

1276
02:01:04,377 --> 02:01:05,869
O Lord Raṅga!

1277
02:01:06,648 --> 02:01:09,712
Oh, such misfortune has befallen Srīraṅgam.

1278
02:01:10,527 --> 02:01:17,019
Great men are even giving up their lives to save Srīraṅgam.

1279
02:01:17,634 --> 02:01:19,931
I am not fortunate enough.

1280
02:01:20,552 --> 02:01:26,521
What service can this lowly dancer do for you, Raṅganātha?

1281
02:01:33,885 --> 02:01:37,293
Yes. Yes, yes, that is the right thing to do.

1282
02:01:37,647 --> 02:01:40,292
I shall go right away to the Sultan’s quarters.

1283
02:01:40,514 --> 02:01:45,201
I shall entice him with my performance and stall the attackers.

1284
02:01:45,450 --> 02:01:48,166
By then they can save Raṅga’s idol.

1285
02:01:48,467 --> 02:01:51,631
This would be my service to Raṅganātha.

1286
02:01:52,016 --> 02:01:54,982
I shall do this even at the cost of my life.

1287
02:02:02,711 --> 02:02:03,411
Swāmi.

1288
02:02:05,175 --> 02:02:05,875
Swāmi!

1289
02:02:09,096 --> 02:02:11,588
Who are you, girl? What happened?

1290
02:02:12,293 --> 02:02:16,020
This is dancer Padminī, the one who lights the lamps for Raṅganātha.

1291
02:02:18,022 --> 02:02:26,913
I went to the Sultan’s quarters and mesmerised him with my dance and song.

1292
02:02:32,266 --> 02:02:34,845
He too lost himself.

1293
02:02:36,684 --> 02:02:41,275
To stall him, I consumed liquor with the same mouth that

1294
02:02:41,261 --> 02:02:48,882
I drank Raṅganātha’s pristine holy water with.

1295
02:02:50,466 --> 02:02:58,585
And I fed him poison-filled liquor with my own hands.

1296
02:03:00,237 --> 02:03:07,787
His army is now like a headless chicken.

1297
02:03:08,027 --> 02:03:14,370
Please use this opportunity and take away our Lord.

1298
02:03:16,174 --> 02:03:17,728
I have a request.

1299
02:03:17,712 --> 02:03:22,514
Would Raṅga accept this lowly sinner, Swāmi?

1300
02:03:26,226 --> 02:03:29,238
Would you pray for me, Swāmi?

1301
02:03:32,101 --> 02:03:34,092
The lord will certainly accept you, child.

1302
02:03:34,778 --> 02:03:40,802
Lord Srī Raṅganātha, please accept this pure soul.

1303
02:03:50,156 --> 02:03:53,622
She is a holy woman.

1304
02:03:53,957 --> 02:03:58,084
Please perform all the final rites befitting a Vaiṣṇava.

1305
02:05:56,396 --> 02:05:58,193
Vēṅkaṭanātha!

1306
02:05:59,373 --> 02:06:02,685
A big responsibility awaits you.

1307
02:06:02,854 --> 02:06:03,819
Yes, Swāmi.

1308
02:06:04,345 --> 02:06:09,838
<i>Yes, indeed. We successfully saved the Utsava idol.</i>

1309
02:06:10,512 --> 02:06:16,571
Having built this stone wall, I am going to follow Him.

1310
02:06:16,552 --> 02:06:17,595
Vēṅkaṭanātha!

1311
02:06:17,897 --> 02:06:22,054
I swear on Raṅganātha. You must not follow Him.

1312
02:06:22,491 --> 02:06:24,433
Swāmi, what are you saying?

1313
02:06:24,456 --> 02:06:27,261
You are like Hanumān;

1314
02:06:28,170 --> 02:06:30,323
… the root of this tradition.

1315
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:39,255
Just like how Jāmawant said that if Hanumān were safe, Rāma’s army would be safe,

1316
02:06:39,264 --> 02:06:47,325
if you are alive, Srīraṅgam will regain its glory.

1317
02:06:52,153 --> 02:06:55,277
Vēṅkaṭanātha, I have another request.

1318
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:57,293
Command, Swāmi.

1319
02:06:58,898 --> 02:07:03,527
This is the explanation for Srībhaṣyam, as…

1320
02:07:03,528 --> 02:07:07,909
… learnt during Naḍādūr Ammāḷ’s Kālakśepa.

1321
02:07:08,176 --> 02:07:12,023
I have compiled it in the form of a book.

1322
02:07:12,716 --> 02:07:14,588
I give this to you for safekeeping.

1323
02:07:15,384 --> 02:07:24,268
Go through its contents and explain the same to other students through Kālakśepa.

1324
02:07:24,484 --> 02:07:28,052
I am going to follow Raṅganātha.

1325
02:07:29,752 --> 02:07:34,138
I don’t know if I would ever see you again.

1326
02:07:39,583 --> 02:07:42,845
Both my sons are too young.

1327
02:07:42,934 --> 02:07:44,642
I hand them over to you.

1328
02:07:45,082 --> 02:07:47,919
Show them the right path.

1329
02:07:48,033 --> 02:07:52,551
Be their guru and guide them.

1330
02:07:56,634 --> 02:07:57,595
Raṅga!

1331
02:08:26,294 --> 02:08:29,438
Oh, they have come close!

1332
02:08:29,673 --> 02:08:31,160
Swāmi is in danger.

1333
02:08:31,733 --> 02:08:35,192
I must distract them somehow.

1334
02:08:36,101 --> 02:08:38,241
Raṅga!

1335
02:08:51,830 --> 02:08:55,848
Oh Lord, the Sultan’s army have wreaked havoc here!

1336
02:08:56,410 --> 02:08:58,997
Corpses everywhere.

1337
02:09:00,987 --> 02:09:04,313
Look, there is some movement there!

1338
02:09:05,411 --> 02:09:07,079
Who is there?

1339
02:09:08,398 --> 02:09:11,773
Janārdhana, what happened?

1340
02:09:12,194 --> 02:09:14,961
Where is Swāmi?

1341
02:09:15,198 --> 02:09:16,664
Janārdhana!

1342
02:09:17,908 --> 02:09:20,884
Tell us, where is Swāmi?

1343
02:09:21,273 --> 02:09:24,105
I don’t understand. Where?

1344
02:09:24,250 --> 02:09:26,080
I don’t understand what he is saying!

1345
02:09:45,182 --> 02:09:50,427
Corpses and streams of blood everywhere.

1346
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:59,371
We hear howls of dogs and wolves in place of holy sounds.

1347
02:10:00,327 --> 02:10:03,471
Vultures and crows are hovering around.

1348
02:10:27,932 --> 02:10:30,994
I can hear someone coming.

1349
02:10:31,598 --> 02:10:37,785
Boys, hold your breath and stay still like

1350
02:10:37,786 --> 02:10:42,036
a corpse among these corpses.

1351
02:10:46,081 --> 02:10:48,916
Have no fear, I am right here.

1352
02:11:03,981 --> 02:11:10,498
Oh, how do I find Swāmi among these corpses?

1353
02:11:11,022 --> 02:11:14,085
I feel scared.

1354
02:11:14,225 --> 02:11:17,242
Would we find him alive?

1355
02:11:17,267 --> 02:11:18,818
Don’t say such things, Srīhari.

1356
02:11:41,658 --> 02:11:45,376
Ah, I see some movement there!

1357
02:11:46,489 --> 02:11:49,766
It’s our Swāmi!

1358
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:51,804
Come quickly!

1359
02:11:52,254 --> 02:11:53,675
Oh, is that you?

1360
02:11:53,926 --> 02:11:55,598
I feared it was the Sultan’s army.

Get up slowly.

1368
02:12:27,437 --> 02:12:30,467
We must somehow reach Satyākālam.

02:13:00,832 --> 02:13:02,364
What could have happened?

1373
02:13:02,819 --> 02:13:05,850
Even I am worried, Kaustubha.

1374

1375
02:13:12,104 --> 02:13:17,012
But we have heard nothing about Swāmi for months.

1376
02:13:17,112 --> 02:13:20,591
No news from Srīraṅgam has been good.

1377
02:13:20,816 --> 02:13:27,752
All right, let us all go into the woods in groups and look for Swāmi.

1378
02:13:27,553 --> 02:13:28,589
Yes, let us.

I would like to know what it means.

1446

1527

O Dēvādirāja! Varada! Please protect the temples of all the holy places.

1528
02:27:07,967 --> 02:27:09,334
Swāmi!

1529
02:27:09,342 --> 02:27:10,042
Ah, what?!

1530
02:27:10,069 --> 02:27:11,437
I come bearing great news!

1531
02:27:11,441 --> 02:27:12,141
Is that so?

1532
02:27:12,128 --> 02:27:16,947
Gōpanārya has brought back our Raṅga
to Srīraṅgam to consecrate Him!

1533
02:27:20,676 --> 02:27:23,480
He has requested you to come right away to Srīraṅgam.

1534
02:27:23,537 --> 02:27:26,673
Kumāravarada, that is fantastic news!

1535
02:27:27,583 --> 02:27:31,556
My penance of so many days in Karṇātaka has borne fruits.

1536
02:27:31,631 --> 02:27:32,331
Yes, Swāmi.

1537
02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:39,121
Long live Gōpanārya, who brought Raṅganātha’s idol

1538
02:27:39,122 --> 02:27:45,210
from Tirumala to Señjī and then to Srīraṅgam.

1539
02:27:45,442 --> 02:27:48,812
We are going to Srīraṅgam to pray to Raṅganātha!

1540
02:27:57,273 --> 02:27:59,486
Such a blessing!

Anybody in there? May I come in?

1543
02:28:52,934 --> 02:28:56,266
I’m very much here. Please do come in.

1544

<i>Are you the Vēdānta Dēsika?</i>

1545
02:29:00,881 --> 02:29:03,001
The master of all arts?

1546
02:29:03,648 --> 02:29:08,104
But sculpting is a unique art form. Greater, more refined than others.

1547
02:29:08,092 --> 02:29:10,307
Not your cup of tea.

1548
02:29:10,457 --> 02:29:13,866
You won the Māyāvi with some mantras.

1549
02:29:13,973 --> 02:29:17,954
Fooled the villagers by eradicating the plague using your tantras.

1550
02:29:18,051 --> 02:29:20,946
You dug the well because you know Vāstu Śāstra.

1551
02:29:21,041 --> 02:29:24,340
But sculpting is a different beast.

1552
02:29:24,378 --> 02:29:26,642
Not something you can play tricks with.

1553
02:29:27,255 --> 02:29:30,827
So, you want me to compete with you in sculpting.

1554
02:29:31,189 --> 02:29:31,889
Yes.

1555
02:29:32,723 --> 02:29:35,471
All right, how do you want me to go about it?

1556
02:29:35,795 --> 02:29:39,726
The world says you are an expert in all 64 art forms.

1557
02:29:39,797 --> 02:29:43,592
If that is the case, create your own sculpture

1558

… on a pedestal I give you.

1559
02:29:45,752 --> 02:29:48,895
We shall grade your talent based on it.

1560
02:29:48,957 --> 02:29:52,917
All right, please bring the pedestal.

1561
02:29:53,271 --> 02:29:54,400
Let me bring it.

1562
02:29:57,311 --> 02:29:59,148
This is the pedestal.

1563
02:30:04,369 --> 02:30:08,110
Let’s see; let’s test your skill.

1565
02:30:38,295 --> 02:30:41,643
<i>… on the pedestal that I gave him!</i>

1566
02:30:42,194 --> 02:30:45,121
<i>He is indeed prodigal.</i>

1567
02:30:45,623 --> 02:30:48,885
<i>But … I must find a flaw.</i>

1568
02:30:51,844 --> 02:30:52,544
Ah!

1569
02:30:52,987 --> 02:30:57,573
Something on the right cheek seems amiss.

1570
02:30:57,621 --> 02:31:01,346
Let me scrape it a little with the knife.

1571
02:31:07,928 --> 02:31:10,855
A little better now.

1572
02:31:14,869 --> 02:31:17,862
Oh, your cheek is bleeding!

1573
02:31:18,243 --> 02:31:23,116
Swāmi, I only corrected the idol; why are you hurt?

1574
02:31:23,421 --> 02:31:26,108
This work of yours oozes life.

1575
02:31:26,417 --> 02:31:30,077
A highly exemplary piece of work.

1576
02:31:30,539 --> 02:31:33,962
I disrespected you with my arrogance.

1577
02:31:34,047 --> 02:31:36,738
Please forgive me.

Āchārya and uncle, Appuḷār, or Vāti Hamsāmputāchārya.

1586

02:32:29,772 --> 02:32:37,089
Henceforth, you would pray to this idol of Lakśmī Hayagrīva,
which was worshipped by Rāmānuja.
