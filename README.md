# Ghaṇṭāvatāram Subtitles

This is the project containing the subtitles for the film, Ghaṇṭāvatāram.

The video file is controlled as of now, in order to encourage in-person participation of watching the movie and building a physical social network of people. If you would like to contribute to the project, you would need to obtain the video file from the sources, (a.k.a. the SARAN Sevaks).

## Conventions followed in English subtitles

Of course, subtitles can be added in other languages as well. The English subtitles, due to the limitations in the Latin script, uses the IAST, or the _International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration_, with a few exceptions (such as using 'cha' instead of 'ca' for 'च'/'ச'). Discussion on whether those exceptions are needed is encouraged.

Please go through the [IAST cheatsheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration#Inventory_and_conventions) before you start contributing to the subtitles. Knowledge of _basic_ Sanskrit and _basic_ Tamil are required.

### Keyboard setup

The English subtitle file was created in a GNOME environment, which supports the Compose key. Check if your system supports this functionality. There are third-party applications and scripts available for Windows and Mac to add this ability.

## Adding other languages

Please feel free to fork the repository, add subtitles in other languages and raise a pull request. We would be happy to merge it post review. Also, do add your name to the end of the file, along with the credits for the English subtitles.

When adding subtitles in other languages, do remember **not** to disturb the line numbers and time codes. Great pain has been taken in adding them. If at all there is a need, create an issue in this repo informing us about the error. Except if you have worked with subtitles before and know your way around a subtitle editor.
